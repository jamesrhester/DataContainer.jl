# DataContainer.jl

This is an experimental module that models arbitrary data structures as simple Dicts, then provides methods to create
relational structures (tables) based on those Dicts. It may be simplified or removed in the future, as it essentially is just
creating a way to convert between arbitrary data and a Dict, and then providing a few methods that treat dicts as
relational tables.

It is used by CIF_dREL.jl.
